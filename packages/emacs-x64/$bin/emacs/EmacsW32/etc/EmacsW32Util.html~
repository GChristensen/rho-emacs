    <h2 style="clear:both" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <em>EmacsW32</em> tries to make it easier for an MS Windows user to get used to Emacs.
      (W32 is Emacs' abbreviation for MS Windows.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<em>EmacsW32</em> (described on this page) is a collection of
	Emacs lisp modules and MS Windows programs.  It can make the
	keyboard and other things in Emacs function more like they do
	usually in MS Windows programs.  It also makes Emacs more easy
	to setup by providing unix utilities commonly used by Emacs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>EmacsW32</em> is <b>not</b> Emacs for MS Windows. Instead
        it is an addon to Emacs for MS Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a href="EmacsW32SetupUtilities.html">EmacsW32 Install
	Wizard</a> is what you use to install and setup EmacsW32 on MS
	Windows.  They can also be used to install Emacs itself.  Note
	that you can even easily build your own installation program.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      EmacsW32 was written primarily for MS Windows, but
      parts of it (see <a href="#packages">the list of packages</a>)
      can be used on other platforms too.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may wonder if there is any reason to use Emacs on MS Windows, is it not an editor for GNU/Linux?
      The answer is yes, it is a very good editor for GNU/Linux - and for a lot of other operating systems too.
      And maybe, some day you will be using GNU/Linux?
    </p>
    <p>
      Please notice that EmacsW32 is essentially <a
      href="#packages">a combination of some good packages</a>
      already made available.
      What it offers is trying to bring all these
      enhancement together in a simple fashion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="emacsonw32">Using Emacs On MS Windows</h2>
    <p>
      If you use plain Emacs on MS Windows you will soon notice that
      it does not really behave as other MS Windows applications.  You
      can not access the menus from the keyboard with Alt+letter.  The
      CUA keys (C-c, C-x, C-v and C-z) whichs works in nearly all
      applications does not work.  A networked printer may not work.
      And even if you happen to get used to those anomalities there
      are still problems because Emacs uses some external utilities
      that are not there on MS Windows (to begin with).
    </p>

    <h3 id="emacsw32helps">EmacsW32 Helps</h3>
    <p>
      You may want the power of Emacs.  You may wish to learn Emacs
      because it is available on GNU/Linux too.  Seems good to prepare
      for a move.  Still you may get desperate over all this trouble
      and just give it up.  But don't panic, EmacsW32 will help you
      with part of it.  CUA keys can work.  (You can also use vi keys,
      even together with CUA keys!)  And to make it easier to get
      started some of the most commonly used unix utility programs are
      already included in EmacsW32.  (If you want more see <a
      href="w32-unix-progs.html">Unix Utilities for Emacs on MS
      Windows</a>.)  The ftp program that comes with MS Windows does
      not behave as Emacs expects. Therefore EmacsW32 includes a more
      unix-like ftp program!
    </p>
    <p>
      By default you can not access the menus with Alt+letter as
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">508</a>
      requires, but with the patched version of Emacs that you can get
      together with EmacsW32 you can do that too (even with <a
      href="#StickyKeys">StickyKeys</a> on which is otherwise a
      problem in current Emacs on MS Windows).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem is line endings. On MS Windows this is normally
      CR-LF while it on unix-like operating systems (like GNU/Linux)
      is only LF.  Some files on MS Windows needs CR-LF while other
      files (like XHTML files for example) can use just LF instead.
      Using just LF instead makes it a bit easier to transfer those
      files to other operating systems.  Emacs has good support for
      changing line endings and some support for telling which files
      should or can have LF line endings.  EmacsW32 extends the latter
      a little bit.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keyboard">Using the Keyboard in Emacs</h3>
    <p>
      Emacs uses a lot of keyboard commands. It combines control, meta
      and shift to make it easy to access a lot of often used
      commands.  (Meta is by default Alt - that is why you can not
      access the menus with Alt+letter.)  That takes some time to get
      used to, but you can do a lot without learning them because the
      CUA keys can be used in Emacs.  (Or, if you are used to vi its
      keyboard keys can be used too.)
    </p>
    <h4 id="StickyKeys">Accessibility Feature StickyKeys can Help You</h4>
    <p>
      StickyKeys is a feature on MS Windows for people with a
      disability that makes it hard to type key combinations.  It is
      actually mentioned in <a
      href="http://www.section508.gov/IRSCourse/mod02/printVC.html">508</a>
      requirements for making information technology accessible to
      people with disabilities.  StickyKeys is a feature of MS Windows
      that works also in Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      StickyKeys can be a great help for anyone using Emacs on MS
      Windows.  Some key combinations can be very hard to type,
      especially on a national keyboard.  If you use StickyKeys you
      can (but does not have too) type the keys one by one and that
      makes it much simpler.  As a positive side effect this may
      perhaps also help saving your hands from problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about StickyKeys see <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/stickykeys.aspx">StickyKeys
      on MS Windows</a>.  See also <a
      href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">GNOME User
      Interface Guidelines</a> to learn about how this works in GNOME
      on GNU/Linux.
    </p>

    <h4 id="altgrctrl">AltGr+Control - Is That Possible?</h4>
    <p>
      Emacs uses some keys that are a combination of AltGr+Control.
      Those keys might seem impossible to type on MS Windows since you
      might have heard that AltGr is the same as Alt+Control.  The
      truth is that AltGr is the same as <em>Alt+Left Control</em>.  You
      can still use the <em>AltGr+Right Control</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Important:</i> You must type <em>Right Control</em> before
      <em>AltGr</em> ! Normally the order between shift, control etc
      does not matter, but here they do.  (Previously it was the other
      way round, AltGr before Right Control, but something seems to
      have changed now (2006-12-17).
    </p>

    <h2 id="started">Getting Started with Emacs+EmacsW32</h2>
    <h3 id="install">Installing and Setting Up Emacs+EmacsW32</h3>
    <p>
      Please see <a href="EmacsW32SetupUtilities.html">EmacsW32
      Install Wizard</a> for how to get and install Emacs+EmacsW32.
      <em>Please observe that you need not start emacs server in any
      of the startup files for Emacs (unless you are using the
      unpatched version of Emacs)!</em> Instead Emacs and emacs server
      will be started automatically when you start emacsclient.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Important:</i>

      At the end of installation you must activate the EmacsW32
      specific options inside Emacs to take advantage of them.  Or,
      after installation start Emacs and in the menus choose
      <em>Options - Customize EmacsW32</em>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="another">Determine Which Emacs to Start</h4>
    <p>
      If you want to switch to another version of Emacs run the file
      usethis.exe in the Emacs bin directory and restart Emacs.  This
      will tell emacsclient to use that version of Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since none of the startup files should start emacs server you can run a
      second copy of Emacs without problems if you want to for some
      reason.  Just use emacs.exe then.
    </p>


    <h3 id="openfile">Opening Files from outside Emacs</h3>
    <p>
      To start Emacs and edit a file you can use the various shortcuts
      created at the installation, for example the <em>Send To</em>
      shortcut in Explorer.  There is also a file e.cmd that you
      can copy to your path for open files from the command line.
      Note that this calls emacsclient.exe, not emacs. So you can not
      use the command line switches for emacs.exe, but you can use
      those for emacsclinet.exe instead.  (Emacs default installation
      adds a Start menu entry called GNU Emacs. You should not use
      this if you are using EmacsW32 and the patched version of
      Emacs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When Emacs is started you can of course open files from within
      Emacs.  If you do not want to start Emacs by opening a file as
      above you can use the shortcuts that just starts Emacs or
      e.cmd.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the installation you also have the choice to associate
      files with Emacs (or really emacsclient).
    </p>

    <h4 id="server">Emacs is an Edit Server</h4>
    <p>
      The shortcuts and e.cmd will only start one copy of Emacs
      for you.  If you try to open a file that you are already editing
      Emacs will only switch to the buffer containting that file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use Emacs as an external editor in some program
      you would probably want to enter something like
      <em>"YOUR-PATH\emacsclientw.exe" %*</em> for the edit command.
      For just viewing you can include the --no-wait (short form -n)
      argument which means "do not wait".
    </p>


    <h4 id="ediff">Opening and Comparing Files with Ediff</h4>
    <p>
      As a small convenience you can start Emacs ediff directly from
      the command line with the command file ediff.cmd.
    </p>

    <h3 id="learnemacs">Learning to use Emacs</h3>
    <p>
      Now you are ready to learn Emacs!
      Emacs has a builtin tutorial and builtin documentation.
      From the tutorial you can learn about how to use Emacs from the keyboard.
      Emacs has its own key bindings choosen for what many people have found to be fast and efficient for editing.
      You can however also use CUA keys or vi keys and even those two together with Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good starting place for documentation is to choose Help - Read Emacs Manual from the menus.
      Another good place to start from is <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/">EmacsWiki</a>.
    </p>


    <hr />
    <h2 id="features">Features Added by EmacsW32</h2>
    <h3 id="featsum">Features Summary</h3>

    <p>
      Here is a summary of the features you get with EmacsW32.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<em>Adjustments inside Emacs:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keyboard and mouse handling, you get the common w32 keys for cut, copy, paste and undo
            plus some others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selection is visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recent files list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buffer switching with C-Tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Standard use of Alt key in MS Windows:</em> Emacs
            normally grabs the Alt key for use as Meta key.  You can
            instead use the Windows keys for Meta and leave Alt to MS
            Windows.  However this currently requires that you also
            use a patched version of Emacs which you can find at
            EmacsW32 home page.  (If you download the prepackaged and
            prebuild CVS version of Emacs with EmacsW32 this includes
            the patch.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Extended support for telling which files should have unix
            line endings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commands to create *Shell* style buffers: cmd-shell,
            msys-shell, cygwin-shell.  They are replacements for `M-x
            shell'.  Hopefully their names tells what they does.
          </li>
          <li>
            File name completion with Tab/Shift-Tab in a *Shell*
            buffer started with `M-x shell' running cmd is broken in
            Emacs.  Use `M-x cmd-shell' instead. The *Shell* style
            buffer will be running cmd and have Tab/Shift-Tab
            completion in Windows Command Prompt style.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<em>Integration with MS Windows:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Automatic start of editing server, both from command line
            and shortcuts.  Note: You need the patched version of
            emacsclient that comes with the patched version of
            Emacs+EmacsW32 for this to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shortcuts (Taskbar, Send To, Desktop).
          </li>
          <li>
            Command line files for opening files and running scripts
            (e.cmd), running Emacs' ediff to compare and edit two files
            (ediff.cmd) and elisp compiling (elc.cmd).  These all uses
            emacsclient.  You can copy them to somewhere in your PATH
            if you want to.
          </li>
          <li>
            File associations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simple printing to MS Windows printer (not fancy, but in
            colors, preview possible).
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatically lookup of Registry values (currently only
            GhostScript, GSview and paper size) for advanced printing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for finding Cygwin/MSYS directories automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            w32shell-cmd-here: Command for starting a Command Prompt
            in the current default-directory and with Emacs in the
            path.
          </li>
          <li>
            w32shell-explorer-here: Start explorer in the current
            default-directory.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<em>Commonly Used Unix Programs are Included:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Emacs uses some unix programs for certain commands.
            The most commonly used includes grep, diff, patch etc.
            To make it easier to get started some of these programs comes with EmacsW32.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ftp program can be very useful in Emacs.
            Unfortunately Emacs have problems using the ftp.exe that comes with MS Windows.
            EmacsW32 therefore includes a more unix-like ftp.exe that fits Emacs better.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All the <em>adjustments inside Emacs</em> can be set by options
      that you find under <em>Options - Customize EmacsW32</em> on the menus.  There you also find the automatic
      lookup of the registry values.  Some of the things in <em>integration with
      MS Windows</em> (like shortcuts) most be selected during the installation.
    </p>

    <h3 id="featdet">Features Details</h3>
    <p>
      This list is rather technical and not at all required reading.
    </p>
    <ul id="FEAT">
      <li>
	<strong>Editing server capabilites:</strong> This important
	feature comes with Emacs itself and does two important things
	for you. First, Emacs remembers which files you are
	editing. You can not by mistake have several copies of the
	same file in different editing states.  Second, you can let
	other programs ask Emacs to let you edit a file.  Emacs will
	tell them when you are ready.
        <p>
          For this to work Emacs server must be started.  If you are
          using the patched version of emacsclient the server will
          start automatically when you use emacsclient.  (For
          unpatched Emacs see the documentation that comes with
          Emacs.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Printing:</strong> Quick and easy simple color
	printing to MS Windows default printer (<a
	href="#w32-print.el">w32-print.el</a>) without using external
	programs.  There has been a <a

	>long discussion</a> on the help-gnu-emacs mailing list on
	whether this approach is good or not.  Important to me is that
	it works reliably and integrates well with the printing system
	on MS Windows.  The printing possibilities are approximately
	the same as those you get with the commands
	ps-print-buffer-with-faces or ps-print-region-with-faces in
	Emacs.  On MS Windows however these commands in many cases
	requires that you install an external program for printing.
	(Surprisingly enough this can be the case even for a networked
	printer that is able to understand PostScript.)
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Ctrl-Tab buffer switching:</strong> You can have many
	files open for editing in Emacs.  This package includes a fast
	and easy way to switch to another edited file.  It can be done
	for example with Ctrl-Tab which propably feels rather natural
	for many MS Windows users (it is used for switching tabs
	normally).  (<a href="#swbuff-y.el">swbuff-y.el</a>)

      <li id="alt-key">
	The <strong>Alt-key</strong> can be used to get to the menus.
        (If <em>StickyKeys</em> are used then unfortunately it must be pressed twice to reach the menus.)
        <em>
          <b>Note:</b>
          The emacs.exe in the installation package with Emacs+EmacsW32 based on the CVS
          sources (next generation of Emacs) has been changed to
          allow Alt to be used for the menus and the left and right
          windows keys to be used as Emacs Meta.
          (Using this patched version there are no problems with StickyKeys.)
          The changes can be find in the file patch-&lt;date&gt;.diff that is available on the web site.
        </em>
	This is MS Windows specific.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Frame handling:</strong>
	A new file is shown in either the current frame (which is called "window" by
	normal MS Windows terminology) or in a new frame depending in customized settings.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Maximized by default:</strong> New frames in Emacs can
	be opened maximized by default. Can be customized.  <em>Note
	that if you are using shortcuts in MS Windows those shortcuts
	decides whether the window that the shortcut think it is
	opening should be maximized, normal or minimized.  Since Emacs
	is run as a server accessed with client programs through the
	shortcuts this <b>confuses MS Windows so it changes the Emacs
	server window</b>.</em>
	<!--
	  <strong>Fix for minimized problem: </strong> In some cases
	  Emacs could stay minimized when a file already edited in
	  Emacs is beeing opened a second time in Emacs. A fix for
	  this is included.
	-->
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Common MS Windows Keys:</strong> Several keyboard keys
	commonly used in MS Windows program are setup, including
	<em>CUA-keys</em> (Cut, copy, paste and undo works with
	Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V and Ctrl-Z).  (<a
	href="#cua.el">cua.el</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Selection</strong> of text behaves as expected in MS
	Windows.  It can be done with the shift key and moving keys.
	It is visible.  It can be erased with del and replaced with
	paste or by typing an insertable key.  (<a
	href="#cua.el">cua.el</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
	There is a <strong>Open Recent</strong> entry on the File menu
	to open recently opened files.  (<a
	href="#recentf.el">recentf.el</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        In EmacsW32 you can decide <strong>which files should have
        unix line endings</strong> based on the full file name.  (<a
        href="#emacsw32-eol.el">emacsw32-eol.el</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>On MS Windows some options are automatically filled in
	by Emacs:</strong> On MS Windows Emacs can not automatically
	find programs like GhostScript, since they are normally not in
	the path.  Some of these programs and other values can be
	found and entered into Emacs custom values using <em>Options
	Related to EmacsW32</em> on the Options menu.
	Some programs that comes with EmacsW32 takes care of this.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comes with some unix utilities from <a
        href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net">Gnuwin32</a> </strong>.
        With these you can start using the Emacs commands grep,
        find-grep, ediff etc without having to install anything.  It
        just works, as it should do.

      In <em>viper</em> this normally
      instead runs <em>viper-toggle-key-action</em> which temporary switches to Emacs default keypad map
      and back.
      EmacsW32 can change this to C-x C-z (which normally runs iconify-or-deiconify-frame, which is rather useless on MS Windows).

    <h3 id="alt-war">The Alt-key War between Emacs and MS Windows</h3>
<!--     <p> -->
<!--       The design of Emacs makes it very hungry for keyboard keys. -->
<!--       Normally on MS Windows Emacs grabs the Alt key for its own use as the Meta key. -->
<!--       However the standard use of Alt in MS Windows is thereby -->
<!--       impeded.  If Emacs grabs Alt you can not switch window with -->
<!--       Alt-Tab and you can not reach the menus with Alt.  This is very -->
<!--       annoying to many MS Windows users. -->
<!--     </p> -->
    <p>
      The design of Emacs makes it very hungry for keyboard keys.
      This unfortunately leads to some keyboard conflicts on MS
      Windows. On MS Windows Emacs by default uses the Alt keyboard
      key for what is in Emacs called the Meta key.  However the Alt
      key is used by MS Windows itself and therefore Emacs does not
      see all Alt key combinations.  One of these is Alt-Tab which
      switches between applications' top level windows.  (Emacs could
      with its current design catch Alt-Tab prior to Windows 2000.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the Alt key as Emacs Meta is also unfortunate since it
      prevents the use of Alt for the menus instead. (I think
      Microsoft would have prevented this if they could, since it
      their GUI guidelines says that Alt should be used for the
      menus. Since Alt also is used to move around between fields in
      an application it is however hard for them to do this.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To get out of this problem I have done some changes to Emacs C
      sources that permits the right and left Window keyboard keys to
      be used as as Emacs Meta key.  If you use this changed version
      of Emacs then there is an extra option that allows this feature
      to be turned on.  Using that you can let the Alt key have its
      standard use in MS Windows and still have easy access to Emacs
      Meta key.  (Of course you also need a keyboard with the Window
      keyboard keys, but all newer keyboards have this.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Emacs already without my patch allows the use of the Windows keys as Meta.
      This does unfortunately not work for all Meta key sequences.
      For example Right Window-key + e will bring up Windows Explorer.
      (With my patch it does forward-sentence as expected.)
    </p>


    <h3 id="patches">Patches in Emacs+EmacsW32 distribution</h3>
    <p>
      There are also some patches made to Emacs itself when you are
      using the patched version of Emacs+EmacsW32.  See the <a
      href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html#unpatched">information
      about patches</a> on the EmacsW32 home page for more information
      and the documentation in the EmacsW32 subdirectory of your
      installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to test from elisp if it is the patched version you
      are running then you can use the function
      <em>(emacsw32-is-patched)</em>.
