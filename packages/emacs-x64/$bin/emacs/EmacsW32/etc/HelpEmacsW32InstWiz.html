    <h1>Help for EmacsW32 Install Wizard</h1>
    <p>
      EmacsW32
      Install Wizard will install
      <a href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html">EmacsW32</a> on your computer.
      The Install Wizard is a rather normal MS Windows installation program.
      Like for any wellbehaved installation program nothing is done until
      you in the last step click the <a href="#wbReady">"Install" button</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the steps in the installation are explained below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The drop-down list contains predefined choices, but you may also check the individual alternatives.
      The alternatives are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Unpack Emacs binary distribution file</dt>
      <dd>
        If you do not have Emacs itself installed you can choose this alternative.
        It will give you a link to a binary distribution file for Emacs and unpack it for you.
        (You have to download the file yourself however.)
      </dd>
      <dt>Install EmacsW32 Files</dt>
      <dd>
        This will just copy the EmacsW32 files.
        With this you can use the file emacs.cmd that comes with EmacsW32 to open a file in Emacs using EmacsClient.
      </dd>
      <dt>Windows Integration of EmacsW32</dt>
      <dd>
        <dl>
        <dt>EmacsW32 shortcuts (Desktop, SendTo, Start Programs, Quick Launch)</dt>
        <dd>
          This will add EmacsClientW to Explorer.
        </dd>
        <dt>Associate selected file types with EmacsW32</dt>
        <dd>
          See <a href="#g_FTypePageID">Step: File type associations</a>.
        </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="g_FTypePageID">Step: File type associations</h2>
    <p>
      This step is maybe a bit complicated.
      It is not necessary to do it however.
      If you want to do it then you probably want to choose the second alternative.
      The screen will look like this after that:
    </p>
    <img src="iw-file-type-associations.png" width="503" height="385" alt="File type associations" title="File type associations" />
    <p>
      You can change the list of file extension to those you want.
      The list will be inspected by the installer and it will show you which the current associations are when you click next:
    </p>
    <img src="iw-change-file-associations.png" width="500" height="580" alt="Change file associations" title="Change file associations" />
    <p>
      On this page you can then choose the file extensions you want to associate with Emacs.
      File types have a name, like EmacsFile.
      For a given file there can be several verbs.
      The most common verbs are "Open" (meant to open a file) and "Print" (meant to print a file).
      For each verb for a file type you can define what action to take.
    </p>

    <h2 id="wbReady">Step: Ready to install</h2>
    <p>
      When you have done all your choices for the installation a screen will be shown with a summary of that.
      Nothing is actually installed until you click "Install" here.
