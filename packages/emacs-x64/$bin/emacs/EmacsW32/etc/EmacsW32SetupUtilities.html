      <em>EmacsW32 Installation Wizard</em>s are used to install <a
      href="EmacsW32Util.html">EmacsW32</a> and optionally Emacs itself.
    </p>

    <h2 style="clear: both;" id="overview">Important Installation Steps</h2>
    <p style="clear: both">
      To install EmacsW32 you run the setup program, either in the
      form that contains Emacs or the one without.  You can actually
      install Emacs itself with both version (but you have to download
      the file archive containing the binaries separately if you use
      the setup program that does not include Emacs itself).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to installing Emacs itself the following can be done
      when you run the setup program:
    </p>

    <dl class="bolddt" style="margin-left:2em">
      <dt><a href="#basic-setup">EmacsW32 Basic Setup</a></dt>
      <dd>
	This is actually needed to get Emacs working as good as it
	actually can.  Some people may however want to do this their
	own way so it is optional.  If you choose to do this basic
	setup then <a href="EmacsW32Util.html">EmacsW32</a> will be
	the hub for this and doing the things below (they actually
	can't be done if you don't choose this step).
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="#wininteg">Windows Integration of EmacsW32</a></dt>
      <dd>
	Here you can choose to create shortcuts and do file associations.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="#emacs-custom">Customize EmacsW32</a></dt>
      <dd>
	After finishing the setup you can do some special
	customization useful for an MS Windows user.
      </dd>
    </dl>



    <h3 id="basic-setup">EmacsW32 Basic Setup</h3>

    <p>
      <em>This step installs EmacsW32 files and does some setup necessary for the following steps.</em>
      It includes lisp files used for the other steps
      and a call to emacsw32.el from default.el.
    </p>

    <h4 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h4>

    <p>
      If Emacs is installed in C:\Program Files (this is default) then
      the folder structure could look something like this (all subdirs
      to <em>EmacsW32</em> are not shown):
    </p>
    <pre>
Program Files
    Emacs
        Emacs (the emacs_dir registry entry)
            bin
                emacs.exe
        <em>EmacsW32</em>
            <em>lisp</em> (files used when starting emacs)
        <em>site-lisp</em>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The name Emacs can be changed.  Notice the directories called
      <em>EmacsW32</em> and <em>site-lisp</em>.  These two directories
      will be added when you choose <em>Install EmacsW32 Files</em> at
      the installation.  Note also the subdirectory
      <em>EmacsW32\lisp</em>.  This contains the lisp files used for
      startup.  It also contains the files used by emacsw32.el, like
      htmlize.el.  This directory is first on load-paths so if you
      download a new version of for example htmlize.el then be sure to
      think about this.
    </p>

    <h4 id="gnuserv">Note: Gnuclient/server - not included any more</h4>
    <p>
      Since emacsclient/server that comes with Emacs now works on MS
      Windows gnuclient/server is no longer included in EmacsW32
      (from version 1.10).
    </p>



    <h3 id="wininteg">Windows Integration of EmacsW32</h3>
    <p>
      Here you can choose to create shortcuts and do file
      associations.  Shortcuts are created in Start menu, SendTo (for
      right-clicking on files), Desktop (drag-and-drop) and Quick
      Launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      File associations can be done on two levels. You can let Emacs
      handle all of it (EmacsFile file type) or you can choose to let
      a certain verb for a file type be handled by Emacs.
    </p>



    <h3 id="emacs-custom">Customize EmacsW32</h3>

    <p>
      When you have finished the setup a special options page are
      added to the menus in Emacs under <em>Customize EmacsW32</em>.
      See <a href="EmacsW32Util.html#featsum">EmacsW32</a> for info.
    </p>


    <hr />
    <h2 id="what-is-changed">What the EmacsW32 Install Wizard Changes</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the changes you choose explicitly (like file
      associations, which Emacs to run) and the files copied to your
      pc the wizard only adds uninstall entries to the Registry.
      (Those are what you see Add/Remove Programs in the Control
      Panel.)
    </p>



    <hr />
    <h2 id="unix-utils">Unix Utils that Emacs might need</h2>
    <p>
      EmacsW32 does not include unix utilities that that you may want
      to use with Emacs.  Read <a href="w32-unix-progs.html">Unix
      Utilities for Emacs on MS Windows</a> for information about how
      to get them.
    </p>





    <hr class="divider" />
    <h2 id="package">Building New Distributions of Emacs</h2>
    <p>
      You may for some reason want to build new distributions of
      Emacs.  You may for example want to distribute an Emacs CVS
      snapshot or you may want to distribute Emacs with some modules
      for a specific purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>ReadMe.txt</b> in the EmacsW32 directory has instruction
      for doing this.  Basically what you do is that you setup your
      own Emacs with these utilities.  Then you run a command file
      that is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may of course want to enhance this.  It is quite easy to do
      so by editing the Inno Setup script file that is created for
      your distribution.
      If you want to build Emacs from sources you may want to read
      <a href="w32-build-emacs.html">Building Emacs on MS Windows</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="buildEmacsW32">Building EmacsW32</h2>
    <p>
      Instructions for (re)creation of EmacsW32 distribution can be
      found in the file <b>ReadMe.txt</b> mentioned above.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider" />
    <h2 id="ack">Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>
      EmacsW32 Setup Helper and EmacsW32 Installer are built using the excellent
      Inno Setup free installer for MS Windows. You can find more info about
      Inno Setup at Jordan Russels web site
      <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/" >http://www.jrsoftware.org/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the permission of Ivan Pavlov 7za.exe from 7-zip is included for
      unpacking distribution files. 7-zip is an advanced and free "zip
      program". You can find more information at
      <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" >http://www.7-zip.org/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course many thanks to all Emacs developers!
      Without them there would be nothing to install.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I also wants to thank the beta testers.
      Thansk very much to Fred Kunz for helping me finding problems that made the
      installation fail in certain cases!
