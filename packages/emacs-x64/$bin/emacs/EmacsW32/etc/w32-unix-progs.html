    <p>
      If you start using Emacs on MS Windows you may find that some of
      the unix programs Emacs want to use are not there.  Some of them
      (but not all) are available on MS Windows (because some people
      has taken the trouble to port them there).  This page will tell
      you more about that.
    </p>


    <h2 id="included" style="clear:both">The Most Needed are Included in EmacsW32</h2>
    <p>
      The unix programs you probably needs most often with Emacs are included in EmacsW32:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:2em">
      <em>
        cmp.exe diff.exe diff3.exe find.exe ftp.exe grep.exe
        locate.exe patch.exe sdiff.exe xargs.exe
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are fetched from <a
      href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">Gnuwin32</a>.
      (Some of them may not be needed very often, but were in the packages from GnuWin32 so I added them anyway.)
      Beside those I included <em>tidy.exe</em> which can be used from nXhtml to tidy XHTML files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="cdmline">Most are Command Line Programs</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the unixs programs you may need are command line
      utilities and the easiest way to get Emacs to use them is to put
      them in your PATH.  Some of the programs (like GhostScript and
      GSview) are not meant to be in your path on MS Windows.  You can
      still add them to your PATH, but it may be a bit clumsy since
      they have their own bin directories.
      If you use <a href="EmacsW32Util.html">EmacsW32</a>
      you can let Emacs find the program path for some of them.
    </p>


    <h2 id="howtoget">How to Get the Programs</h2>
    <p>
      There two principle ways to get the unix programs.  You can get
      them as (rather) complete packages or as single programs.  <a
      href="http://www.cygwin.com" >Cygwin</a> and <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org">MSYS</a> are such packages.  If you
      use these alternatives the utility programs should normally be
      run from the command shell (<em>sh.exe</em> or <em>bash.exe</em>) that comes with
      them because they are meant to be used that way.  MSYS is
      currently mostly meant to be used to as an environment for
      compiling programs with the GNU compilers (for example when
      porting unix programs to MS Windows).  This means it is not as
      complete as Cygwin (which is a bigger download).
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been problems with MSYS and Cygwin regarding file
      names, line endings (CRLF versus LF) and with automatic
      compression within Emacs.  Now it seems to me that these things
      works with Cygwin (if you install it the "right" way), but not
      always with MSYS.  <b>I suggest you inside Emacs <a
      href="#cygwin">use Cygwin</a> or <a href="#single">single unix
      programs</a></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single unix programs are fine most of the time, but
      unfortunately there is no really good port of a bash compatible
      shell to native MS Windows.  You need such a shell for unpacking
      and installing some elisp packages. They come sometimes in a
      format that requires a unix sh command and then there are
      currently no good alternatives to using something like MSYS or
      Cygwin.
    </p>


    <h2 id="cygwin">Using Cygwin</h2>
    <p>
      I have installed Cygwin with "Default Text Type" set to "DOS /
      text".  This allows Cygwin programs to recognize MS Windows
      style line endings which I need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cygwin has a setup program with which you download and install
      different parts.  On the page <a
      href="http://cygwin.com/packages/">Cygwin Package List</a> you
      can search for programs you need and to find out which part of
      Cygwin you need to install.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of Emacs you do not normally want Cygwin in your path.
      That could cause problems if Cygwin programs or DLLs have the
      same name as native windows dito.  However inside Emacs it is
      convenient to have it first in your path.  To easily setup Emacs
      to use Cygwin like this you can use w32shell.el (see the <a
      href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/">Emacs download area at
      ourcomments.org</a>).  With w32shell.el you can also add Emacs
      bin directory to the path and switch to Cygwin for interactive
      shells.  Installation of some elisp packages is comfortable to
      do in an interactive Cygwin shell in Emacs where you have Emacs
      in the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle you can use MSYS the same way, but at the moment I do not recommend it.
    </p>


    <h2 id="single">Using Single Unix programs</h2>
    <p>
      Many unix programs has been ported for use with MS Windows
      command shell (<em>cmd.exe</em> on the NT product line).  Those
      are good for use inside of Emacs. A good starting point for such
      programs is <a
      href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">Gnuwin32</a> (<a
      href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</a>).
      Gnuwin32 is divided into packages and sometimes it is hard to
      find the program you need. In this case it might be a good help
      to use for example Google to search the Gnuwin32 web site.
      (Search for example for <em>site:gnuwin32.sourceforge.net
      packages diff</em>.)  You may also find the perl program I
      written to download and install Gnuwin32 packages useful, see <a
      href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/w32%20util/gnuwin32/gnuwin32dl.html">Gnuwin32DL
      documentation</a> (download <a
      href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/w32%20util/gnuwin32/gnuwin32dl.pl">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note however that there is no updated unix style shell available
      that you easily can use together with the single unix programs.
    </p>

    <h2 id="findmore">Where to Find More</h2>
    <p>
      There are some other programs you may need that are not included
      in any of the alternatives above.
      <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/links.html" >Gnuwin32 has a link page</a> from
      which you may find some of those programs (for example <b>GhostScript</b> and <b>GsView</b>).
