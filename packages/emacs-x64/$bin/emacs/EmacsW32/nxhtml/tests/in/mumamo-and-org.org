* Test of org and mumamo

  Below is a html chunk

#+BEGIN_HTML 
<p>
  I have <b>no</b> idea of how to use this yet.
</p>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-mode something else
            (defun my-function (msg)
              (when msg
                (message "The message was %S" msg)))
#+END_SRC

#+begin_src emacs-lisp-mode
            (defun my-fun-in-lower-case (msg)
              (when msg
                (message "The message was %S" msg)))
#+end_src
Q: Where are the "..." in org-mumamo-mode???
A: They are here now!

** Some subnode

Hm, org full header lines are broken, why?
Does not seem related to mumamo.
No, it has been fixed, now, org-mode bug.
