;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains functions for interactive resizing of Emacs
;; windows.  To use it put it in your `load-path' and add the following
;; to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'winsize)
;;     (global-set-key [(control x) ?+] 'resize-windows)
;;
;; For more information see `resize-windows'.
;;
;; These functions are a slightly rewritten version of the second part
;; of the second part my proposal for a new `balance-windows' function
;; for Emacs 22.  The rewrite is mostly a restructure to more easily
;; add new functions.  All functions and variables have been renamed.
;; The file was originally named bw-interactive.el.
;;
;; New ideas for functionality have been to a large part adopted from
;; the Emacs Devel mailing list.  Probably most of them originated from
;; Drew Adams and Bastien.

During resizing a window is selected.  You can move its

 (All the normal help keys work, and at least those above will
  play well with resizing.)

You can use keys and commands listed in `winsize-let-me-use' as
normal.  This means that you by default can use your normal keys
for `forward-char', `backward-char', `next-line',
`previous-line' and what you have on HOME and END to move in the
windows.  That might sometimes be necessary to directly select a
window.  \(You may however also use `other-window' or click with
the mouse, see below.)


The colors of the modelines are changed to those given in
`winsize-mode-line-colors' to indicate that you are resizing
windows.  To make this indication more prominent the text in the
selected window is marked with the face hold in the variable
`winsize-selected-window-face'.

The option `winsize-juris-way' decides how the borders to move
are selected. If this option is non-nil then the right or bottom
border are the ones that are moved with the arrow keys and the
opposite border with shift arrow keys.

If `winsize-juris-way' is nil then the following apply:

As you select other borders or move to new a window the mouse
pointer is moved inside the selected window to show which borders
are beeing moved. The mouse jumps a little bit to make its
position more visible. You can turn this off by customizing
`winsize-make-mouse-prominent'.

Which borders initially are choosen are controlled by the
variable `winsize-autoselect-borders'.

** Example: Border selection, movements and windows.

  Suppose you have a frame divided into windows like in the
  figure below.  If window B is selected when you start resizing
  then \(with default settings) the borders marked with 'v' and
  'h' will be the ones that the arrow keys moves. To indicate
  this the mouse pointer is placed in the right lower corner of
  the selected window B.

  Note that the window A is now selected. However there is no
  border that could be moved to the left of this window \(which
  would otherwise be chosen now) so the border between A and B is
  still the one that <left> and <right> moves. The mouse has
  moved to A.

  If we now delete window A the new situation will look like
  this:
