NotReadme.txt
*************

This file was installed by Emacs Setup Helper for MS Windows. This
file is here just to explain a curiosity.

The directory (typically something like C:\Program Files\Emacs) where
this file is installed exists for technical reasons. It depends on the
way the used installer program (Inno Setup) currently works and the
way Emacs Setup Helper installs the Emacs files.

Where to find the readme file: ReadMe.txt
*****************************************
You may or you may not find the installed Emacs in this directory.
This depends on where you choosed to have your Emacs files. If you do
not know where they are (for some reason) you can find them in
Emacs. The variable +exec-directory+ tells this. The directory above this
contains a subdirectory named "setup" with a file named ReadMe.txt
with more info.

**** Important note: There is also a copy of this file in the "setup"
subdirectory.  It is there to allow building new installations.
