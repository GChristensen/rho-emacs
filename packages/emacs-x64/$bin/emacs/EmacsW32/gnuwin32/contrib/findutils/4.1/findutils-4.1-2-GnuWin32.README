* FindUtils-4.1 for Windows *
=============================

What is it?
-----------
FindUtils: find and then operate on files

Description
-----------
`find' is a program which searches a directory tree to find a file or
group of files. It walks the directory tree and reports all occurences
of a file matching the user's specifications. 

`locate' scans one or more databases of filenames and displays any matches. 

`xargs' builds and executes command lines by gathering together arguments
it reads on the standard input. Most often, these arguments are lists of
file names generated by `find'.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in findutils-4.1-2-GnuWin32.diffs in findutils-4.1-2-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
