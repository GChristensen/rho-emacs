Major changes in release 4.1:

* Distribution renamed to findutils.
* updatedb is now a user command, installed in $exec_prefix/bin
  instead of $exec_prefix/libexec.
* A few problems in Makefiles and testsuite corrected.

Major changes in release 4.0:

* Documentation:
** Texinfo manual.
** Man page for updatedb.
** Man page for the locate database formats.

* find:
** Takes less CPU time on long paths, because it uses chdir to descend
   trees, so it does fewer inode lookups.
** Does not get trapped in symbolic link loops when -follow is given.
** Supports "-fstype afs" if you have /afs and /usr/afsws/include
   and you configure using the --with-afs option.
** New action -fls FILE; like -ls but writes to FILE.

* locate:
** Supports a new database format, which is 8-bit clean and
   allows machines with diffent byte orderings and integer sizes to
   share the databases.  The new locate can also detect and read the
   old database format automatically.  The new databases are typically
   30% or more larger than the old ones (due to allowing all 8 bits in
   file names).  Search times are approximately the same, or faster on
   some systems.
** Warns if a file name database is more than 8 days old.

* updatedb:
** Takes command-line options.

* xargs:
** Performance improved 10-20%.
** The EOF string is not used when -0 is given.
** Now has a test suite.  Some minor bugs fixed as a result.

Major changes in release 3.7:

* locate can search multiple databases
* locate has an option to specify the database path
* updatedb no longer goes into an infinite loop with some versions of tail
