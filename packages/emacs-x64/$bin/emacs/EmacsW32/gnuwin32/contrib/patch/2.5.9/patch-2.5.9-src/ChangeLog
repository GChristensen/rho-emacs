	chmod rej file to input file's mode minus executable bits.
	(locate_hunk): Go back to old way of a single fuzz parameter, but

	-B now implies backup, and requires nonempty operand.
	-D no longer requires first char of argument to be an identifier.

	since condition is always true the first time through the loop.
	(init_output, init_reject): Arg is now const *.
	(copy_till, spew_output): Do not insert ``missing'' newlines;
	propagate them via new after_newline argument.
	(spew_output): Nothing to copy if last_frozen_line == input lines.
	Do not close (ofp) if it's null.
	(dump_line): Remove.

	Strip paths as they're being fetched.
	Set ok_to_create_file correctly even if patch is reversed.
	Set up file names correctly with unidiff output.
	Use algorithm specified by POSIX 1003.2b/D11 to deduce
	name of file to patch, with the exception of patches
	that can create files.
	(skip_to): Be verbose if !inname, since we're about to ask the
	user for a file name and the context will help the user choose.
	(another_hunk): Keep context as LINENUM, not int.
	If the replacement is missing, calculate its context correctly.
	Don't assume input ends in newline.

	Work even if lines are incomplete.
	Fix bugs associated with context-less context hunks,
	particularly when patching in reverse.
	(pget_line): Now takes just 1 arg; instead of second arg,
	just examine using_plan_a global.  Return -1 if we ran out

	Take name of editor from ED_PROGRAM instead of hardwiring /bin/ed.
	Don't bother unlinking TMPOUTNAME.

	Treat a sequence of one or more slashes like one slash.
	Do not unstrip leading directories if they all exist and if
	no -p option was given; POSIX doesn't allow this.
	(memcmp): Remove (now a macro in common.h).

	* version.c (copyright_string, free_software_msgid, authorship_msgid):
	New constants.
	(version): Use them.  Use program_name instead of hardwiring it.

	configure, to get the right args passed.

Thu Jul 29 07:46:16 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* The following changes remove all remaining fixed limits on memory,
	and fix bugs in patch's handling of null bytes and files that do not
	end in newline.  `Patch' now works on binary files.

	* backupfile.c (find_backup_file_name): Don't dump core if malloc fails.

	* EXTERN.h, INTERN.h (EXITING): New macro.
	* backupfile.[ch], patch.c, pch.c: Add PARAMS to function declarations.

	* common.h (bool): Change to int, so ANSI C prototype promotion works.

	(filearg): Now a pointer, not an array, so that it can be reallocated.
	(GET*, SCCSDIFF, CHECKOUT*, RCSDIFF): Quote operands to commands.

	definers changed.
	(INT_MAX, INT_MIN, STD*_FILENO, SEEK_SET): Define if the underlying
	system doesn't.  Include <limits.h> for this.

	* configure.in: Add limits.h, memcmp.  Delete getline.

	* inp.c (tibufsize): New variable; buffers grow as needed.
	(TIBUFSIZE_MINIMUM): New macro.
	(report_revision): New function.
	(plan_a): Do not search patch as a big string, since that fails
	if it contains null bytes.
	Prepend `./' to filenames starting with `-', for RCS and SCCS.
	If file does not match default RCS/SCCS version, go ahead and patch
	it anyway; warn about the problem but do not report a fatal error.
	(plan_b): Do not use a fixed buffer to read lines; read byte by byte
	instead, so that the lines can be arbitrarily long.  Do not search
	lines as strings, since they may contain null bytes.
	(plan_a, plan_b): Report I/O errors.

	* inp.c, inp.h (rev_in_string): Remove.
	(ifetch): Yield size of line too, since strlen no longer applies.

	All invokers changed.
	(main, get_some_switches, apply_hunk): Allocate *_define[ds], filearg,
	rejname dynamically.
	(make_temp): New function.
	(main): Use it.
	(main, spew_output, dump_line) Check for I/O errors.

	it's a regular file, since we can seek on it directly.
	(open_patch_file, skip_to, another_hunk): The patch file may contain
	NULs.
	(another_hunk): The patch file may contain lines starting with '\',
	which means the preceding line lacked a trailing newline.
	(pgetline): Rename to pget_line.
	(get_line, incomplete_line, pch_write_line): New functions.
	(pch_line_len): Return size_t, not short; lines may be very long.

	'i' and 's' commands, too.

	* pch.h (pfp, grow_hunkmax, intuit_diff_type, next_intuit_at, skip_to,
	pfetch, pgetline): No longer exported.

	pseudo-varargs functions weren't ANSI C.  Replace by macros
	that invoke [fs]printf directly, and invoke new functions
	[az]{say,fatal,pfatal,ask} before and after.
	(savebuf, read_fatal, write_fatal, memory_fatal, Fseek): New functions.
	(fatal*): Output trailing newline after message.  All invokers changed.

	patching, remove it.
	(get_some_switches): Recognize -E option.

	* patch.c (copy_till): Make garbled output an error, not a warning
	that doesn't change the exit status.

	* Configure: Look for C library where NeXT and SVR4 put it.
	Look in /usr/ucb after /bin and /usr/bin for utilities,
	and look in /usr/ccs/bin, to make SVR4 happier.

	* patchlevel.h: PATCHLEVEL 12u5.

	* Makefile.SH: Change clean, distclean, and realclean targets a
	little so they agree with the GNU coding standards.

	* Configure: Recognize Domain/OS C library in /lib/libc.
	From mmuegel@mot.com (Michael S. Muegel).

	* pch.c: Fixes from Wayne Davison:
	Patch now accepts no-context context diffs that are
	specified with an assumed one line hunk (e.g.  "*** 10 ****").
	Fixed a bug in both context and unified diff processing that would
	put a zero-context hunk in the wrong place (one line too soon).
	Fixed a minor problem with p_max in unified diffs where it would
	set p_max to hunkmax unnecessarily (the only adverse effect was to
	not supply empty lines at eof by assuming they were truncated).

Tue Jul  2 03:25:51 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Configure: Check for signal declaration in
	/usr/include/sys/signal.h as well as /usr/include/signal.h.

	* Configure, common.h, config.h.SH: Comment out the sprintf
	declaration and tests to determine its return value type.  It
	conflicts with ANSI C systems' prototypes in stdio.h and the
	return value of sprintf is never used anyway -- it's always cast
	to void.

Thu Jun 27 13:05:32 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* pch.c (another_hunk): Fix from Wayne Davison to recognize
	single-line hunks in unified diffs (with a single line number
	instead of a range).

	* inp.c (rev_in_string): Don't use `s' before defining it.  From
	Wayne Davison.

	* Configure: When checking for C preprocessor, look for 'abc.*xyz'
	instead of 'abc.xyz', so ANSI C preprocessors work.

	* Apply fix for -D from ksb@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (Kevin Braunsdorf).

1990-05-01  Wayne Davison  <davison@dri.com>
	* patch.c, pch.c: unidiff support added

Wed Mar  7 23:47:25 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)
