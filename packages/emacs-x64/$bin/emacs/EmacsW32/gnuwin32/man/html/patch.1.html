  but usually just <p>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>patch</b>
takes a patch file <i>patchfile</i> containing a difference listing produced by
the <b>diff</b> program and applies those differences to one or more original
files, producing patched versions. Normally the patched versions are put
in place of the originals. Backups can be made; see the <b>-b</b> or <b>backup</b> option.
The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the patch file,
but if there&rsquo;s just one file to be patched it can specified on the command
line as <i>originalfile</i>. <p>
Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type
of the diff listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c</b> (<b>context</b>), <b>-e</b> (<b>ed</b>), <b>-n</b> (<b>normal</b>),
or <b>-u</b> (<b>unified</b>) option. Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and
normal diffs are applied by the <b>patch</b> program itself, while <b>ed</b> diffs are
simply fed to the <a href='ed.1.html'><b>ed</b>(1)</a>
 editor via a pipe. <p>
<b>patch</b> tries to skip any leading
garbage, apply the diff, and then skip any trailing garbage. Thus you could
feed an article or message containing a diff listing to <b>patch</b>, and it should
work. If the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount, or if a context
diff contains lines ending in <font size='-1'>CRLF</font>
 or is encapsulated one or more times
by prepending "<b>- </b>" to lines starting with "<b>-</b>" as specified by Internet RFC
934, this is taken into account. After removing indenting or encapsulation,
lines beginning with <b>#</b> are ignored, as they are considered to be comments.
<p>
With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, <b>patch</b> can
detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch. As a
first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus
any offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is not the correct
place, <b>patch</b> scans both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching
the context given in the hunk. First <b>patch</b> looks for a place where all lines
of the context match. If no such place is found, and it&rsquo;s a context diff,
and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more, then another scan takes
place ignoring the first and last line of context. If that fails, and the
maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines
of context are ignored, and another scan is made. (The default maximum fuzz
factor is 2.) If <b>patch</b> cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch,
it puts the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the
output file plus a <b>.rej</b> suffix, or <b>#</b> if <b>.rej</b> would generate a file name that
is too long (if even appending the single character <b>#</b> makes the file name
too long, then <b>#</b> replaces the file name&rsquo;s last character). (The rejected
hunk comes out in ordinary context diff form regardless of the input patch&rsquo;s
form. If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply null.)
The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than
in the patch file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the
failed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one. <p>
As each hunk
is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if so which line (in
the new file) <b>patch</b> thought the hunk should go on. If the hunk is installed
at a different line from the line number specified in the diff you are
told the offset. A single large offset <i>may</i> indicate that a hunk was installed
in the wrong place. You are also told if a fuzz factor was used to make
the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious. If the
<b>verbose</b> option is given, you are also told about hunks that match exactly.
<p>
If no original file <i>origfile</i> is specified on the command line, <b>patch</b> tries
to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit
is, using the following rules. <p>
First, <b>patch</b> takes an ordered list of candidate
file names as follows: 
<dl>

<dt><b> </b> If the header is that of a context diff, </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b>
takes the old and new file names in the header. A name is ignored if it
does not have enough slashes to satisfy the <b>-p</b><i>num</i> or <b>strip=</b><i>num</i> option. The
name <b>/dev/null</b> is also ignored. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> If there is an </dt>
<dd><b>Index:</b> line in the leading
garbage and if either the old and new names are both absent or if <b>patch</b>
is conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
, <b>patch</b> takes the name in the <b>Index:</b> line. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> For the
purpose of the following rules, </dt>
<dd>the candidate file names are considered
to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless of the order that they
appear in the header. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Then <b>patch</b> selects a file name from the candidate
list as follows: 
<dl>

<dt><b> </b> If some of the named files exist, </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b> selects the
first name if conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
, and the best name otherwise. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> If </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b>
is not ignoring <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
, ClearCase, Perforce, and <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
 (see the <b>-g&nbsp;</b><i>num</i> or <b>get=</b><i>num</i>
option), and no named files exist but an <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
, ClearCase, Perforce, or <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>

master is found, <b>patch</b> selects the first named file with an <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
, ClearCase,
Perforce, or <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
 master. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> If no named files exist, </dt>
<dd>no <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
, ClearCase,
Perforce, or <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
 master was found, some names are given, <b>patch</b> is not
conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
, and the patch appears to create a file, <b>patch</b> selects
the best name requiring the creation of the fewest directories. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> If no
file name results from the above heuristics, you are asked </dt>
<dd>for the name
of the file to patch, and <b>patch</b> selects that name. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
To determine the <i>best</i>
of a nonempty list of file names, <b>patch</b> first takes all the names with
the fewest path name components; of those, it then takes all the names
with the shortest basename; of those, it then takes all the shortest names;
finally, it takes the first remaining name. <p>
Additionally, if the leading
garbage contains a <b>Prereq:</b> line, <b>patch</b> takes the first word from the prerequisites
line (normally a version number) and checks the original file to see if
that word can be found. If not, <b>patch</b> asks for confirmation before proceeding.
<p>
The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news
interface, something like the following: <p>
  <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<b>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</b><br>
 <p>
  and patch a file in the <b>blurfl</b> directory directly from the article containing
the patch. <p>
If the patch file contains more than one patch, <b>patch</b> tries to
apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files. This means,
among other things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch
must be determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage before each
diff listing contains interesting things such as file names and revision
level, as mentioned previously. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-b</b>  or  <b>backup</b> </dt>
<dd>Make backup files. That
is, when patching a file, rename or copy the original instead of removing
it. When backing up a file that does not exist, an empty, unreadable backup
file is created as a placeholder to represent the nonexistent file. See
the <b>-V</b> or <b>version-control</b> option for details about how backup file names
are determined. </dd>

<dt><b>backup-if-mismatch</b> </dt>
<dd>Back up a file if the patch does not match
the file exactly and if backups are not otherwise requested. This is the
default unless <b>patch</b> is conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
. </dd>

<dt><b>no-backup-if-mismatch</b> </dt>
<dd>Do not back
up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly and if backups are
not otherwise requested. This is the default if <b>patch</b> is conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
.
</dd>

<dt><b>-B</b> <i>pref</i>  or  <b>prefix=</b><i>pref</i> </dt>
<dd>Prefix <i>pref</i> to a file name when generating its
simple backup file name. For example, with <b>-B&nbsp;/junk/</b> the simple backup file
name for <b>src/patch/util.c</b> is <b>/junk/src/patch/util.c</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>binary</b> </dt>
<dd>Read and write
all files in binary mode, except for standard output and <b>/dev/tty</b>. This
option has no effect on <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
-conforming systems. On systems like <font size='-1'>DOS</font>
 where
this option makes a difference, the patch should be generated by <b>diff&nbsp;-a&nbsp;binary</b>.
</dd>

<dt><b>-c</b>  or  <b>context</b> </dt>
<dd>Interpret the patch file as a ordinary context diff. </dd>

<dt><b>-d</b> <i>dir</i>
 or  <b>directory=</b><i>dir</i> </dt>
<dd>Change to the directory <i>dir</i> immediately, before doing
anything else. </dd>

<dt><b>-D</b> <i>define</i>  or  <b>ifdef=</b><i>define</i> </dt>
<dd>Use the <b>#ifdef</b> ... <b>#endif</b> construct
to mark changes, with <i>define</i> as the differentiating symbol. </dd>

<dt><b>dry-run</b> </dt>
<dd>Print
the results of applying the patches without actually changing any files.
</dd>

<dt><b>-e</b>  or  <b>ed</b> </dt>
<dd>Interpret the patch file as an <b>ed</b> script. </dd>

<dt><b>-E</b>  or  <b>remove-empty-files</b>
</dt>
<dd>Remove output files that are empty after the patches have been applied.
Normally this option is unnecessary, since <b>patch</b> can examine the time stamps
on the header to determine whether a file should exist after patching. However,
if the input is not a context diff or if <b>patch</b> is conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
,
<b>patch</b> does not remove empty patched files unless this option is given. When
<b>patch</b> removes a file, it also attempts to remove any empty ancestor directories.
</dd>

<dt><b>-f</b>  or  <b>force</b> </dt>
<dd>Assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing,
and do not ask any questions.  Skip patches whose headers do not say which
file is to be patched; patch files even though they have the wrong version
for the <b>Prereq:</b> line in the patch; and assume that patches are not reversed
even if they look like they are. This option does not suppress commentary;
use <b>-s</b> for that. </dd>

<dt><b>-F</b> <i>num</i>  or  <b>fuzz=</b><i>num</i> </dt>
<dd>Set the maximum fuzz factor. This option
only applies to diffs that have context, and causes <b>patch</b> to ignore up
to that many lines in looking for places to install a hunk. Note that a
larger fuzz factor increases the odds of a faulty patch. The default fuzz
factor is 2, and it may not be set to more than the number of lines of
context in the context diff, ordinarily 3. </dd>

<dt><b>-g</b> <i>num</i>  or  <b>get=</b><i>num</i> </dt>
<dd>This option
controls <b>patch</b>&rsquo;s actions when a file is under <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
 or <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
 control, and does
not exist or is read-only and matches the default version, or when a file
is under ClearCase or Perforce control and does not exist. If <i>num</i> is positive,
<b>patch</b> gets (or checks out) the file from the revision control system; if
zero, <b>patch</b> ignores <font size='-1'>RCS</font>
, ClearCase, Perforce, and <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
 and does not get
the file; and if negative, <b>patch</b> asks the user whether to get the file.
The default value of this option is given by the value of the <b>PATCH_GET</b>
environment variable if it is set; if not, the default value is zero if
<b>patch</b> is conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
, negative otherwise. </dd>

<dt><b>help</b> </dt>
<dd>Print a summary of
options and exit. </dd>

<dt><b>-i</b> <i>patchfile</i>  or  <b>input=</b><i>patchfile</i> </dt>
<dd>Read the patch from <i>patchfile</i>.
If <i>patchfile</i> is <b>-</b>, read from standard input, the default. </dd>

<dt><b>-l</b>  or  <b>ignore-whitespace</b>
</dt>
<dd>Match patterns loosely, in case tabs or spaces have been munged in your
files. Any sequence of one or more blanks in the patch file matches any
sequence in the original file, and sequences of blanks at the ends of lines
are ignored. Normal characters must still match exactly. Each line of the
context must still match a line in the original file. </dd>

<dt><b>-n</b>  or  <b>normal</b> </dt>
<dd>Interpret
the patch file as a normal diff. </dd>

<dt><b>-N</b>  or  <b>forward</b> </dt>
<dd>Ignore patches that seem
to be reversed or already applied. See also <b>-R</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-o</b> <i>outfile</i>  or  <b>output=</b><i>outfile</i>
</dt>
<dd>Send output to <i>outfile</i> instead of patching files in place. Do not use this
option if <i>outfile</i> is one of the files to be patched. </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b><i>num</i>  or  <b>strip</b><b>=</b><i>num</i>
</dt>
<dd>Strip the smallest prefix containing <i>num</i> leading slashes from each file
name found in the patch file. A sequence of one or more adjacent slashes
is counted as a single slash. This controls how file names found in the
patch file are treated, in case you keep your files in a different directory
than the person who sent out the patch. For example, supposing the file
name in the patch file was <p>
  <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<b>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b><br>
 <p>
  setting <b>-p0</b> gives the entire file name unmodified, <b>-p1</b> gives <p>
  <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<b>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b><br>
 <p>
  without the leading slash, <b>-p4</b> gives <p>
  <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<b>blurfl/blurfl.c</b><br>
 <p>
  and not specifying <b>-p</b> at all just gives you <b>blurfl.c</b>. Whatever you end
up with is looked for either in the current directory, or the directory
specified by the <b>-d</b> option. </dd>

<dt><b>posix</b> </dt>
<dd>Conform more strictly to the <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
 standard,
as follows. <blockquote></dd>

<dt><b> </b> Take the first existing file from the list (old, new, index)
</dt>
<dd>when intuiting file names from diff headers. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> Do not remove files that
are empty after patching. </dt>
<dd><font size='-1'></font>
</dd>

<dt><b> </b> Do not ask whether to get files from RCS, ClearCase,
Perforce, </dt>
<dd>or <font size='-1'>SCCS</font>
. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> Require that all options precede the files in the command
line. </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b> </b> Do not backup files when there is a mismatch. </dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b>quoting-style=</b><i>word</i> </dt>
<dd>Use
style <i>word</i> to quote output names. The <i>word</i> should be one of the following:
<blockquote></dd>

<dt><b>literal</b> </dt>
<dd>Output names as-is. </dd>

<dt><b>shell</b> </dt>
<dd>Quote names for the shell if they contain
shell metacharacters or would cause ambiguous output. </dd>

<dt><b>shell-always</b> </dt>
<dd>Quote
names for the shell, even if they would normally not require quoting. </dd>

<dt><b>c</b>
</dt>
<dd>Quote names as for a C language string. </dd>

<dt><b>escape</b> </dt>
<dd>Quote as with <b>c</b> except omit
the surrounding double-quote characters. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
You can specify the default value
of the <b>quoting-style</b> option with the environment variable <b>QUOTING_STYLE</b>.
If that environment variable is not set, the default value is <b>shell</b>. </blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b>-r</b> <i>rejectfile</i>
 or  <b>reject-file=</b><i>rejectfile</i> </dt>
<dd>Put rejects into <i>rejectfile</i> instead of the default
<b>.rej</b> file. </dd>

<dt><b>-R</b>  or  <b>reverse</b> </dt>
<dd>Assume that this patch was created with the old
and new files swapped. (Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid that does happen occasionally, human
nature being what it is.) <b>patch</b> attempts to swap each hunk around before
applying it. Rejects come out in the swapped format. The <b>-R</b> option does not
work with <b>ed</b> diff scripts because there is too little information to reconstruct
the reverse operation. <p>
  If the first hunk of a patch fails, <b>patch</b> reverses
the hunk to see if it can be applied that way. If it can, you are asked
if you want to have the <b>-R</b> option set. If it can&rsquo;t, the patch continues to
be applied normally. (Note: this method cannot detect a reversed patch if
it is a normal diff and if the first command is an append (i.e. it should
have been a delete) since appends always succeed, due to the fact that
a null context matches anywhere. Luckily, most patches add or change lines
rather than delete them, so most reversed normal diffs begin with a delete,
which fails, triggering the heuristic.) </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b>  or  <b>silent</b>  or  <b>quiet</b> </dt>
<dd>Work silently,
unless an error occurs. </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b>  or  <b>batch</b> </dt>
<dd>Suppress questions like <b>-f</b>, but make
some different assumptions: skip patches whose headers do not contain file
names (the same as <b>-f</b>); skip patches for which the file has the wrong version
for the <b>Prereq:</b> line in the patch; and assume that patches are reversed
if they look like they are. </dd>

<dt><b>-T</b>  or  <b>set-time</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the modification and access
times of patched files from time stamps given in context diff headers,
assuming that the context diff headers use local time.  This option is not
recommended, because patches using local time cannot easily be used by
people in other time zones, and because local time stamps are ambiguous
when local clocks move backwards during daylight-saving time adjustments.
 Instead of using this option, generate patches with <font size='-1'>UTC</font>
 and use the <b>-Z</b>
or <b>set-utc</b> option instead. </dd>

<dt><b>-u</b>  or  <b>unified</b> </dt>
<dd>Interpret the patch file as a unified
context diff. </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b>  or  <b>version</b> </dt>
<dd>Print out <b>patch</b>&rsquo;s revision header and patch
level, and exit. </dd>

<dt><b>-V</b> <i>method</i>  or  <b>version-control=</b><i>method</i> </dt>
<dd>Use <i>method</i> to determine
backup file names.  The method can also be given by the <b>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</b>
(or, if that&rsquo;s not set, the <b>VERSION_CONTROL</b>) environment variable, which
is overridden by this option. The method does not affect whether backup
files are made; it affects only the names of any backup files that are
made. <p>
  The value of <i>method</i> is like the <font size='-1'>GNU</font>
 Emacs &lsquo;version-control&rsquo; variable;
<b>patch</b> also recognizes synonyms that are more descriptive.  The valid values
for <i>method</i> are (unique abbreviations are accepted): <blockquote></dd>

<dt><b>existing</b>  or  <b>nil</b> </dt>
<dd>Make
numbered backups of files that already have them, otherwise simple backups.
This is the default. </dd>

<dt><b>numbered</b>  or  <b>t</b> </dt>
<dd>Make numbered backups.  The numbered
backup file name for <i>F</i> is <i>F</i><b>.~</b><i>N</i><b>~</b> where <i>N</i> is the version number. </dd>

<dt><b>simple</b>  or
 <b>never</b> </dt>
<dd>Make simple backups. The <b>-B</b> or <b>prefix</b>, <b>-Y</b> or <b>basename-prefix</b>, and <b>-z</b>
or <b>suffix</b> options specify the simple backup file name. If none of these
options are given, then a simple backup suffix is used; it is the value
of the <b>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</b> environment variable if set, and is <b>.orig</b> otherwise.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
With numbered or simple backups, if the backup file name is too long, the
backup suffix <b>~</b> is used instead; if even appending <b>~</b> would make the name
too long, then <b>~</b> replaces the last character of the file name. </blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b>verbose</b> </dt>
<dd>Output
extra information about the work being done. </dd>

<dt><b>-x</b> <i>num</i>  or  <b>debug=</b><i>num</i> </dt>
<dd>Set internal
debugging flags of interest only to <b>patch</b> patchers. </dd>

<dt><b>-Y</b> <i>pref</i>  or  <b>basename-prefix=</b><i>pref</i>
</dt>
<dd>Prefix <i>pref</i> to the basename of a file name when generating its simple backup
file name. For example, with <b>-Y&nbsp;.del/</b> the simple backup file name for <b>src/patch/util.c</b>
is <b>src/patch/.del/util.c</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-z</b> <i>suffix</i>  or  <b>suffix=</b><i>suffix</i> </dt>
<dd>Use <i>suffix</i> as the simple
backup suffix. For example, with <b>-z&nbsp;-</b> the simple backup file name for <b>src/patch/util.c</b>
is <b>src/patch/util.c-</b>. The backup suffix may also be specified by the <b>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</b>
environment variable, which is overridden by this option. </dd>

<dt><b>-Z</b>  or  <b>set-utc</b>
</dt>
<dd>Set the modification and access times of patched files from time stamps
given in context diff headers, assuming that the context diff headers use
Coordinated Universal Time (<font size='-1'>UTC</font>
, often known as <font size='-1'>GMT</font>
). Also see the <b>-T</b> or
<b>set-time</b> option. <p>
  The <b>-Z</b> or <b>set-utc</b> and <b>-T</b> or <b>set-time</b> options normally refrain
from setting a file&rsquo;s time if the file&rsquo;s original time does not match the
time given in the patch header, or if its contents do not match the patch
exactly.  However, if the <b>-f</b> or <b>force</b> option is given, the file time is set
regardless. <p>
  Due to the limitations of <b>diff</b> output format, these options
cannot update the times of files whose contents have not changed.  Also,
if you use these options, you should remove (e.g. with <b>make&nbsp;clean</b>) all files
that depend on the patched files, so that later invocations of <b>make</b> do
not get confused by the patched files&rsquo; times. </dd>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Notes for Patch Senders</a></h2>
There
are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be sending
out patches. <p>
Create your patch systematically. A good method is the command
<b>diff&nbsp;-Naur&nbsp;</b><i>old&nbsp;new</i> where <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> identify the old and new directories. The
names <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> should not contain any slashes. The <b>diff</b> command&rsquo;s headers
should have dates and times in Universal Time using traditional Unix format,
so that patch recipients can use the <b>-Z</b> or <b>set-utc</b> option. Here is an example
command, using Bourne shell syntax: <p>
  <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<b>LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7
gcc-2.8</b><br>
 <p>
Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling them which directory
to <b>cd</b> to, and which <b>patch</b> options to use.  The option string <b>-Np1</b> is recommended.
Test your procedure by pretending to be a recipient and applying your patch
to a copy of the original files. <p>
You can save people a lot of grief by keeping
a <b>patchlevel.h</b> file which is patched to increment the patch level as the
first diff in the patch file you send out. If you put a <b>Prereq:</b> line in
with the patch, it won&rsquo;t let them apply patches out of order without some
warning. <p>
You can create a file by sending out a diff that compares <b>/dev/null</b>
or an empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 <font size='-1'>UTC</font>
) to the file you
want to create. This only works if the file you want to create doesn&rsquo;t exist
already in the target directory. Conversely, you can remove a file by sending
out a context diff that compares the file to be deleted with an empty file
dated the Epoch. The file will be removed unless <b>patch</b> is conforming to
<font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
 and the <b>-E</b> or <b>remove-empty-files</b> option is not given. An easy way to
generate patches that create and remove files is to use <font size='-1'>GNU</font>
 <b>diff</b>&rsquo;s <b>-N</b> or
<b>new-file</b> option. <p>
If the recipient is supposed to use the <b>-p</b><i>N</i> option, do not
send output that looks like this: <p>
  <b> <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README<br>
 <br>
<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;--- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997<br>
 <br>
<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;+++ prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997<br>
 <p>
</b>  because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and different
versions of <b>patch</b> interpret the file names differently. To avoid confusion,
send output that looks like this instead: <p>
  <b> <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README
v2.0.30/prog/README<br>
 <br>
<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;--- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997<br>
 <br>
<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;+++ v2.0.30/prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997<br>
 <p>
</b>  <p>
Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like <b>README.orig</b>,
since this might confuse <b>patch</b> into patching a backup file instead of the
real file. Instead, send patches that compare the same base file names in
different directories, e.g. <b>old/README</b> and <b>new/README</b>. <p>
Take care not to send
out reversed patches, since it makes people wonder whether they already
applied the patch. <p>
Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g. the
file <b>configure</b> where there is a line <b>configure: configure.in</b> in your makefile),
since the recipient should be able to regenerate the derived files anyway.
If you must send diffs of derived files, generate the diffs using <font size='-1'>UTC</font>
,
have the recipients apply the patch with the <b>-Z</b> or <b>set-utc</b> option, and have
them remove any unpatched files that depend on patched files (e.g. with <b>make&nbsp;clean</b>).
<p>
While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings into one
file, it may be wiser to group related patches into separate files in case
something goes haywire. 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Diagnostics</a></h2>
Diagnostics generally indicate that <b>patch</b>
couldn&rsquo;t parse your patch file. <p>
If the <b>verbose</b> option is given, the message
<b>Hmm...</b> indicates that there is unprocessed text in the patch file and that
<b>patch</b> is attempting to intuit whether there is a patch in that text and,
if so, what kind of patch it is. <p>
<b>patch</b>&rsquo;s exit status is 0 if all hunks are
applied successfully, 1 if some hunks cannot be applied, and 2 if there
is more serious trouble. When applying a set of patches in a loop it behooves
you to check this exit status so you don&rsquo;t apply a later patch to a partially
patched file. 
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Caveats</a></h2>
Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation
or deletion of empty files, empty directories, or special files such as
symbolic links. Nor can they represent changes to file metadata like ownership,
permissions, or whether one file is a hard link to another. If changes like
these are also required, separate instructions (e.g. a shell script) to accomplish
them should accompany the patch. <p>
<b>patch</b> cannot tell if the line numbers are
off in an <b>ed</b> script, and can detect bad line numbers in a normal diff only
when it finds a change or deletion. A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may
have the same problem. Until a suitable interactive interface is added,
you should probably do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes
made sense. Of course, compiling without errors is a pretty good indication
that the patch worked, but not always. <p>
<b>patch</b> usually produces the correct
results, even when it has to do a lot of guessing. However, the results
are guaranteed to be correct only when the patch is applied to exactly
the same version of the file that the patch was generated from. 
<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Compatibility
Issues</a></h2>
The <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
 standard specifies behavior that differs from <b>patch</b>&rsquo;s traditional
behavior. You should be aware of these differences if you must interoperate
with <b>patch</b> versions 2.1 and earlier, which do not conform to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
. 
<dl>

<dt><b> </b> In
traditional </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b>, the <b>-p</b> option&rsquo;s operand was optional, and a bare <b>-p</b> was
equivalent to <b>-p0.</b> The <b>-p</b> option now requires an operand, and <b>-p&nbsp;0</b> is now equivalent
to <b>-p0</b>. For maximum compatibility, use options like <b>-p0</b> and <b>-p1</b>. <p>
  Also, traditional
<b>patch</b> simply counted slashes when stripping path prefixes; <b>patch</b> now counts
pathname components. That is, a sequence of one or more adjacent slashes
now counts as a single slash. For maximum portability, avoid sending patches
containing <b>//</b> in file names. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> In traditional </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b>, backups were enabled
by default. This behavior is now enabled with the <b>-b</b> or <b>backup</b> option. <p>
  Conversely,
in <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
 <b>patch</b>, backups are never made, even when there is a mismatch. In
<font size='-1'>GNU</font>
 <b>patch</b>, this behavior is enabled with the <b>no-backup-if-mismatch</b> option,
or by conforming to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
 with the <b>posix</b> option or by setting the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
environment variable. <p>
  The <b>-b</b><i>&nbsp;suffix</i> option of traditional <b>patch</b> is equivalent
to the <b>-b&nbsp;-z</b><i>&nbsp;suffix</i> options of <font size='-1'>GNU</font>
 <b>patch</b>. </dd>

<dt><b> &#183;</b> Traditional </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b> used a complicated
(and incompletely documented) method to intuit the name of the file to
be patched from the patch header. This method did not conform to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
,
and had a few gotchas. Now <b>patch</b> uses a different, equally complicated (but
better documented) method that is optionally <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
-conforming; we hope it
has fewer gotchas.  The two methods are compatible if the file names in
the context diff header and the <b>Index:</b> line are all identical after prefix-stripping.
Your patch is normally compatible if each header&rsquo;s file names all contain
the same number of slashes. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> When traditional </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b> asked the user a question,
it sent the question to standard error and looked for an answer from the
first file in the following list that was a terminal: standard error, standard
output, <b>/dev/tty</b>, and standard input. Now <b>patch</b> sends questions to standard
output and gets answers from <b>/dev/tty</b>. Defaults for some answers have been
changed so that <b>patch</b> never goes into an infinite loop when using default
answers. </dd>

<dt><b> </b> Traditional </dt>
<dd><b>patch</b> exited with a status value that counted the
number of bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real trouble. Now <b>patch</b>
exits with status 1 if some hunks failed, or with 2 if there was real trouble.
</dd>

<dt><b> </b> Limit yourself to the following options when sending instructions </dt>
<dd>meant
to be executed by anyone running <font size='-1'>GNU</font>
 <b>patch</b>, traditional <b>patch</b>, or a <b>patch</b>
that conforms to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
. Spaces are significant in the following list, and
operands are required. <p>
  <br>
<pre>-c-d dir-D define-e-l-n-N-o outfile-pnum-R-r rejectfile</pre></dd>

<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Bugs</a></h2>
Please report bugs via
email to <b>&lt;bug-patch@gnu.org&gt;</b>. <p>
<b>patch</b> could be smarter about partial matches,
excessively deviant offsets and swapped code, but that would take an extra
pass. <p>
If code has been duplicated (for instance with <b>#ifdef OLDCODE</b> ... <b>#else
... #endif</b>), <b>patch</b> is incapable of patching both versions, and, if it works
at all, will likely patch the wrong one, and tell you that it succeeded
to boot. <p>
If you apply a patch you&rsquo;ve already applied, <b>patch</b> thinks it is
a reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the patch. This could be construed
as a feature.

Larry
Wall wrote the original version of <b>patch</b>. Paul Eggert removed <b>patch</b>&rsquo;s arbitrary
limits; added support for binary files, setting file times, and deleting
files; and made it conform better to <font size='-1'>POSIX</font>
. Other contributors include Wayne
Davison, who added unidiff support, and David MacKenzie, who added configuration
and backup support. <p>
