To build a distribution of Rho Emacs you need the following tools somewhere 
on your PATH:

 * mingw-w64/g++ 7+ (https://mingw-w64.org or just use Rho Shell with C++ installed)
 * makensis (http://nsis.sourceforge.net)

The source snapshot contains only installer and configuration framework, so you
also should provide binary distributions of necessary package dependenices. 
You can simply extract existing packages at the corresponding folders in
`software' subdir of the source snapshot or download and install dependencies 
manually, if necessary. To add new packages you must explore existing packages
to understand their structure.

NOTE: installer will merge any subdirectory beginning with `$' in the package 
      root folder with the same directory without `$'.
